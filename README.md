## Project Overview
The web application is an online store of children's furniture. The online store contains a catalog of products in stock and on order. The administrator manages the catalog, controls the availability of products, processes orders, accepts supplies of products, and controls user access. To place an order, a client needs to register using an up-to-date e-mail, after which it becomes available to manage his orders and profile.
